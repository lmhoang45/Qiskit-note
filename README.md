# Qiskit-note
When writing this note, I just finished my first year as a Ph.D. student in North America. I am interested in Quantum computing as a research topic for my dissertation. I am also looking for an internship next summer. Putting these together, the Quantum Computing Internship at IBM research is a perfect match and a goal to aim for.
I browsed for some internship opportunities at IBM, and here are few things I learn.
