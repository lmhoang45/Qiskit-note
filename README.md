When writing this note, I just finished my first year as a Ph.D. student in North America. I am interested in Quantum computing as a research topic for my dissertation. I am also looking for an internship next summer. Putting these together, the Quantum Computing Internship at IBM research is a perfect match and a goal to aim for.
I browsed for some internship opportunities at IBM, and here are few things I learn.

This link may be disabled in the future, so I captured a screenshot ![](/JD.JPG)

Quite a few things to do, huh? Some of the relevant links.

### [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/learn)
A good tutorial on Qiskit and relevant knowledge, from Basics of Quantum information, Quantum algorithms (classics from Shor's and Grover's, and more recent developments such as VQE and QAOA), to Qubits, Entanglement, Quantum protocols, Quantum circuits, and Quantum machine learning (of course!)

### [Qiskit Advocates program](https://qiskit.org/advocates)
Details about the program and some useful notes [here](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/application-guide). A few things that count:
   - Your community contribution. Learn how to [contribute](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/application-guide#contributions)
   - Take a [test](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/application-guide#test): more details [here](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300) and [here](https://slides.com/javafxpert/prep-qiskit-dev-cert-exam#/22/0/4).
